<span class="description">According to Paragraph1, all of the following are true statements about Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia EXCEPT Collectively, these regions are traditionally known as Oceania. These islands of Micronesia are small and spread out Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand mark the boundaries of Polynesia. Melanesia is situated to the north of Micronesia.Paragraph2: Speculation on the origin of these Pacific islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered them, in the absence of solid linguistic, archaeological, and biological data, many fanciful and mutually exclusive theories were devised. Pacific islanders ere variously thought to have come from North America, South America, Egypt, Israel, and India, as well as Southeast Asia. Many older theories implicitly deprecated the navigational abilities and overall cultural creativity of the Pacific islanders. For example, British anthropologists G. Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry assumed that only Egyptians would have been skilled enough to navigate and colonize the Pacific. They inferred that the Egyptians even crossed the Pacific to found the great civilizations of the New World (North and South America). In1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted on a balsa-log raft westward with the winds and currents across the Pacific from South America to prove his theory that Pacific islanders were Native Americans (also called American Indians). Later Heyerdahl suggested that the Pacific was peopled by three migrations: by Native Americans from the Pacific Northwest of North America drifting to Hawaii, by Peruvians drifting to Easter Island, and by Melanesians. In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in an Egyptian style reed boat to prove Egyptian influences in the Americas. Contrary to these theorists, the overwhelming evidence of physical anthropology, linguistics, and archaeology shows that the Pacific islanders came from Southeast Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail against the prevailing winds and currents.2. By stating that the theories are mutually exclusive the author means that if one of the theories is true, then all the others must be false the differences between the theories are unimportant taken together, the theories cover all possibilities the theories support each other3. The word overwhelming in the passage is closest in meaning to powerful favorable current reasonable4. According to Paragraph2, which of the following led some early researchers to believe that the Pacific islanders originally came from Egypt? Egyptians were known to have founded other great civilizations. Sailors from other parts of the world were believed to lack the skills needed to travel across the ocean. Linguistic, archaeological, and biological data connected the islands to Egypt. Egyptian accounts claimed responsibility for colonizing the Pacific as well as the Americas.5. Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph2 about early theories of where the first inhabitants of the Pacific islands came from? They were generally based on solid evidence. They tried to account for the origin of the characteristic features of the languages spoken by Pacific islanders. They assumed that the peoples living in Southeast Asia did not have the skills needed to sail to the Pacific islands. They questioned the ideas of G. Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry.Paragraph3: The basic cultural requirements for the successful colonization of the Pacific islands include the appropriate boat-building, sailing, and navigation skills to get to the islands in the first place, domesticated plants and gardening skills suited to often marginal conditions, and a varied inventory of fishing implements and techniques. It is now generally believed that these prerequisites originated with peoples speaking Austronesian languages (a group of several hundred related languages) and began to emerge in Southeast Asia by about 5000 B. C.E. The culture of that time, based on archaeology and linguistic reconstruction, is assumed to have had a broad inventory of cultivated plants including taro, yarns, banana, sugarcane, breadfruit, coconut, sago, and rice, Just as important, the culture also possessed the basic foundation for an effective maritime adaptation, including outrigger canoes and a variety of fishing techniques that could be effective for overseas voyaging.6. The word implements in the passage is closest in meaning to skills tools opportunities practices7. All of the following are mentioned in Paragraph3 as required for successful colonization of the Pacific islands EXCEPT knowledge of various Austronesian languages a variety of fishing techniques navigational skills knowledge of plant cultivation8. In Paragraph3, why does the author provide information about the types of crops grown and boats used in Southeast Asia during the period around 5000 B. C. E.? To evaluate the relative importance of agriculture and fishing to early Austronesian peoples. To illustrate the effectiveness of archaeological and linguistic methods in discovering details about life in ancient times. To contrast living conditions on the continent of Asia with living conditions on the Pacific islands. To demonstrate that people from this region had the skills and resources necessary to travel to and survive on the Pacific islands.Paragraph4: Contrary to the arguments of some that much of the pacific was settled by Polynesians accidentally marooned after being lost and adrift, it seems reasonable that this feat was accomplished by deliberate colonization expeditions that set out fully stocked with food and domesticated plants and animals. Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the Pacific. These expeditions were likely driven by population growth and political dynamics on the home islands, as well as the challenge and excitement of exploring unknown waters. Because all Polynesians, Micronesians, and many Melanesians speak Austronesian languages and grow crops derived from Southeast Asia, all these peoples most certainly derived from that region and not the New World or elsewhere. The undisputed pre-Columbian presence in Oceania of the sweet potato, which is a New World domesticate, has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl’s “American Indians in the Pacific” theories. However, this is one plant out of a long list of Southeast Asian domesticates. As Patrick Kirch, an American anthropologist, points out, rather than being brought by rafting South Americans, sweet potatoes might just have easily been brought back by returning Polynesian navigators who could have reached the west coast of South America.9. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information. Some people have argued that the Pacific was settled by traders who became lost while transporting domesticated plants and animals. The original Polynesian settlers were probably marooned on the islands, but they may have been joined later by carefully prepared colonization expeditions. Although it seems reasonable to believe that colonization expeditions would set out fully stocked, this is contradicted by much of the evidence. The settlement of the Pacific islands was probably intentional and well planned rather than accidental as some people have proposed.10. The word undisputed in the passage is closest in meaning to mysterious unexpected acknowledged significant11. According to Paragraph4, which of the following is NOT an explanation for why a group of people might have wanted to colonize the Pacific islands? As their numbers increased, they needed additional territory. The winds and currents made the islands easy to reach. The political situation at home made emigration desirable, They found exploration challenging and exciting.12. Why does the author mention the views of “Patrick Kirch”? To present evidence in favor of Heyerdahl’s idea about American Indians reaching Oceania To emphasize the familiarity of Pacific islanders with crops from many different regions of the world To indicate that supposed proof for Heyerdahl’s theory has an alternative explanation. To demonstrate that some of the same crops were cultivated in both South America and Oceania.Paragraph2: Speculation on the origin of these Pacific islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered them, in the absence of solid linguistic, archaeological, and biological data, many fanciful and mutually exclusive theories were devised.
